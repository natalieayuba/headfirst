    "about": "Seeing out the summer in sizzling style with an masterclass in sultry, sleazy and jacking sounds from the disco-sphere and beyond as two maestros of the dancefloor step into The Red Church for an Sunday service like no other..\n\nSystem Olympia\nWith one stiletto planted firmly in the bathhouse and the other stepping out of a vintage Mercedes, System Olympia oozes style with a selection to die for and unique universe in which she spins her sound. Spanning disco, house, boogie, italo, soul, jazz and rare grooves - all with a distinctive System Olympia touch. A prolific producer alongside her DJ ventures, reworking hiphop classics into sultry soulful numbers, dusty downtempo house cuts and melancholic italo for those eyes-closed dancefloor moments. In short, you better not miss this..\n\nDJ October\nA bona-fide icon of the booth with bags deeper than the Mariana Trench - we've secured a very special set which will see October trip through the sound of NYC's queer 80s disco to pumping italo synth lines, dirty house jackers and plenty of left turns and surprise selections... A truly genre defying and decade spanning DJ, strap in.\n\nBurly Chassis\nParadisco's resident weirdo-disco selector, warming up the sound system with tripped out balearic sounds, punk-funk edits, technicolour disco shimmer and no-wave dancefloor frenzy.\n\nWe're going extra intimate for this one, tickets in advance HIGHLY recommended.",
