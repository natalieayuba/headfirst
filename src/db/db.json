      "about": "Seeing out the summer in sizzling style with an masterclass in sultry, sleazy and jacking sounds from the disco-sphere and beyond as two maestros of the dancefloor step into The Red Church for an Sunday service like no other..\n\nSystem Olympia\nWith one stiletto planted firmly in the bathhouse and the other stepping out of a vintage Mercedes, System Olympia oozes style with a selection to die for and unique universe in which she spins her sound. Spanning disco, house, boogie, italo, soul, jazz and rare grooves - all with a distinctive System Olympia touch. A prolific producer alongside her DJ ventures, reworking hiphop classics into sultry soulful numbers, dusty downtempo house cuts and melancholic italo for those eyes-closed dancefloor moments. In short, you better not miss this..\n\nDJ October\nA bona-fide icon of the booth with bags deeper than the Mariana Trench - we've secured a very special set which will see October trip through the sound of NYC's queer 80s disco to pumping italo synth lines, dirty house jackers and plenty of left turns and surprise selections... A truly genre defying and decade spanning DJ, strap in.\n\nBurly Chassis\nParadisco's resident weirdo-disco selector, warming up the sound system with tripped out balearic sounds, punk-funk edits, technicolour disco shimmer and no-wave dancefloor frenzy.\n\nWe're going extra intimate for this one, tickets in advance HIGHLY recommended.",

She earned the name 'Halgan' - The Fighter - in the 1980's when she was involved in the terrible war against the dictatorship. This afforded her admiration - but it is her music that has made her an icon. Uplifting yet reverent, it is music filled with soul and courage and love. Her music encapsulates the hope and strength of her community and has become deeply embedded in the heart of Somaliland.\n\nExiled to France, she started her group in Lyon with Aymeric Krol, Maël Salètes and Régis Monte. This ensemble gave the principles behind the music embodiment, allowing it to move people through their bodies - in other words it's music to dance to, with nods to afrobeat, tuareg and ethio-jazz. Her third album is the fruit of a search to elevate this important voice, expand it's sonic landscape and share it with a wider audience. It's called ‘Hiddo Dhawr’ (‘Preserve Culture’), which is also the name of the cultural centre that Sahra founded in 2013 in Hargeisa.\n\nEntry requirements: 14+, any under 18s accompanied by 21+ adult 1:1 ratio",

      "about": "Ear Trumpet Presents. Brooks Williams & Aaron Catlow Seated Show at Bristol Folk House, 40a Park St, BS1 5JG - All Ages (Under 18s to be accompanied by a responsible adult)\n\nDoors 7:00pm, Show 8:00pm\n\nBrooks Williams & Aaron Catlow create joyous and virtuosic music that not only tugs at the heart-strings but also gets you up on your feet. AmericanaUK writes, “how such a complete and sensational sound can come from just two voices and instruments is awe-inspiring.”\n\nA year on from their debut tour, the two have literally been wowing audiences at venues and festivals like St David’s Hall, Lichfield Guildhall, Folk In A Field Festival, Cumberland Arms, Ely Festival, The Folk House and The Atkinson, to name but a few.\n\nInspired by the response to their shows, Brooks Williams and Aaron Catlow have been back in the studio. This time with Josh Clark (Kate Rusby) at Get Real Audio. Alongside Jon Short (John Martyn Project) on double bass, they have created Greens And Blues, a vibrant collection of songs, some penned by Williams and others by Gillian Welch, Shirley Collins, Molly Tuttle, Rab Noakes and Sierra Ferrell, among others.\n\nThe playing on Greens And Blues has a spontaneity that reflects the hours and hours they have spent onstage in front of audiences. It’s a potent combination. Free and rooted all at once.\n\nOne of the eleven tracks on Greens And Blues is Dooley’s Farm (Molly Tuttle) about a farmer who is particularly adept at growing a very popular (but illegal) crop. The Williams/Catlow arrangement is dark and spooky, complete with sliding double bass lines and guitar arpeggios. Another is Wild Wild Wild (Brooks Williams), a description of a music venue Williams played in the earliest days of his career, that swings with reckless abandon, much like the venue itself. Gillian Welch’s Red Clay Halo gets a fertile reading from Brooks and Aaron, complete with nimble guitar picking, fiddle double-bowing and Aaron’s whistling!\n\nThroughout the recording, the interplay between Williams’ guitar and Catlow’s fiddle is out-of-this-world. Take Anniesland, one of Brooks’ songs. The fiddle kicks it off with a folky-old-timey riff. You think you know where it’s going. Then the guitar snakes its way into the middle of that with bluesy double-stops that turns the song on its head. The riff is so deep it sticks with you long after the song is over. On the late-great Rab Noakes’ Little Way Up, a previously unrecorded song from the Noakes’ back catalogue, guitar and fiddle go full-on country, doubling the melody in a way that would make the Tennessee Three proud.\n\nWith three albums under their belt, Ghost Owl in 2021 (nominated “Instrumental Album Of The Year” by Fatea) and Ready For The Times in 2022 (“a cracker,” says Living Tradition), and Greens And Blues in 2024, Brooks Williams and Aaron Catlow are moving deeper into their sound. There is literally no one else on the scene playing this kind of music. You see fiddle and guitar and you think you know what to expect, but Williams and Catlow deliver something completely different. They are a one-off. After virtually every gig they get asked to return for a future engagement.\n\nAaron Catlow is half of the Bristol-based duo Hawes And Catlow, with guitarist-singer Kit Hawes. He is also the fiddler in UK festival favourite Sheelanagig. Catlow's other credits including playing with Grammy Award-nominated Yola, Mad Dog Mcrea and Afro Celt Sound System.\n\nCambridge UK-based, Georgia US-born, Brooks Williams has a long-standing solo career in both North America and the UK and is also known for his collaborations with the likes of Dan Walsh, Sloan Wainwright, Hans Theessink, Boo Hewerdine, Guy Davis and Rab Noakes, among others. He is named one of WUMB-FM Boston's Top 100 All-Time Artists. Fatea refers to him as “one of those select few 'how on earth does he do it?!' artists.\"\n\nNot only are Brooks Williams and Aaron Catlow masters of their respective instruments, but the music they create, says Folk Radio UK, is “a thing of beauty!”\n\n“The audience loved every minute and afterwards begged them to return to the stage.... ” (Big Wheel Blues Club, Isle Of Man)\n\n\"One of the best nights ever. Great songs, great fun and wonderful musicianship. Do not hesitate. Go and see Brooks and Aaron while you can. You will have the best time.\" (Grateful Fred’s, The Atkinson, Southport)\n\n\"An outstanding performance of sublime quality, entertaining and beautifully paced. Two musicians at the top of their game.\"(RAFA Club, Cleethorpes)\n\neartrumpet\n\nEntry requirements: no age restrictions (under 18s to be accompanied by an adult over 21yrs, 1:1 ratio)",

Spearheaded by Sameer Khan, who's formally trained by a 600-year-old lineage of musicians from modern-day Pakistan, this group of multi-instrumentalists aims to bring timeless tradition to new realms.\n\nBy daring to embrace the Hindustani format while drinking from retro aesthetics and resignifying it all with the avant-gardism of neo-psych, they create something both recognizable and new.\n\nSet to release their debut album in 2023, the group became known for their captivating performances fuelled by a plethora of electrified folk instruments, and increasingly gained space in the live circuit, supporting established acts such as Witch, Os Mutantes Dur Dur Band and Sarathy Korwar.\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n18+ event.\nPresented by Gravy Train & BLG.\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\nGravy Train events • www.gravytrainbristol.co.uk\nBLG events • www.linktr.ee/BLGPromotions\n",

      "about": "Presented by the Bristol Radical History Group, Acts of Resistance is an opportunity to time-travel through radical history. This new project “Avant-Folk Punk-Opera is the new project of Steve Lake, of anarcho-/post punk band Zounds,[ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zounds ] rocking since the late 1970s.\n\nActs Of Resistance is a performance of songs, verse and prose commemorating and celebrating 1,000 years of protest and dissent by the commoners of England. Original songs and stories are merged with adaptations of traditional material and found stories to weave a continuous thread that links working people’s struggle across the generations. Hear the voices of history from below such as The Diggers, William Blake, and King Ludd.\n\nActs of Resistance features a redoubtable trio made up of Steve Lake (self-described “chief show off” with legendary anarcho-punk band Zounds, [https://zoundsonline.co.uk/ ] first appearing on Crass Records and nexus for all kinds of musical troublemakers), Bristolian Emo-folkster Aether Valentine, and Carl Phillip Louis (“folk-punk free-jazz mandolinist and singer/shouter of anarcho-romance poetry”).\n\nAfter the performance, Pete Webb of BRHG and DIY music publisher PC-Press will facilitate a question-and-answer session with Steve Lake of Zounds, an opportunity which should not be passed up lightly. As well as tours and friendships with Crass and The Poison Girls, Zounds were among the original wave of anarcho-punk bands, particularly The Mob, Astronauts, Blythe Power and the Poison Girls, all bands that regularly played West Country benefit gigs and free festivals during the late 1970s and early 1980s. From the outset Zounds lyrics have been political without being predictably didactic. They are also unnervingly melodic for fans of hardcore punk, featuring accessible rhythms and beats that gave them wide appeal beyond the punk scene, with danceable favourite as “Subvert” even having a distinctly ska rhythm.\n\nHistory is dead!

      "about": "PLANTOID • www.instagram.com/plantoidworld\n\nMusically, Plantoid’s cauldron harnesses multiple subgenres at once to concoct a sort of primordial soup, the molecules of which are built as much from progressive rock as they are jazz, fusion, folk, and even a bit of ‘70s hard rock for good measure. The band began as the brainchild of Chloe and Tom Coyne, who met while pursuing music courses at Lincoln College in their teens. Quickly united by a passion for eclectic psychedelic rock, and far-out, emotionally charged songwriting, they formed the band Mangö and started gigging around town with drummer Louis Bradshaw, who Tom had been friends with since secondary school.\n\nAfter making a name for themselves locally, the three relocated to Brighton and recruited bassist Bernardo Larisch. Now a four-piece, and renamed Plantoid, the band were ready to dig even deeper into their shared influences, ranging from Miles Davis to Todd Rundgren, to Jeff Buckley, all the way around to the more acute experimental fare that gives Plantoid their razor-sharp edge. \n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\nSURFACE AIR • www.instagram.com/surfaceairband\n\nFrom the splintering bone ashes of prog, punk and the sallow remains of no-wave springs a rare bird of apocryphal breed. SURFACE AIR is a newly formed Bristol-based three piece and features Kilian Lee (WINDSHAKE) on guitar and vocals, Oliver Cocup (Lawi Anywar, My Octopus Mind) on drums and Arthur Harrison-Ward (Captain Gas, Dog Daughter) on bass. Immediate musical influences include King Crimson, METZ and St. Vincent. Initial aims are to create a body of work for live performance and imminent recording\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n18+ event.\nPresented by Gravy Train & BLG.\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\nGravy Train events • www.gravytrainbristol.co.uk\nBLG events • www.linktr.ee/BLGPromotions",
