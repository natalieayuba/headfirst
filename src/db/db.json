      "about": "Seeing out the summer in sizzling style with an masterclass in sultry, sleazy and jacking sounds from the disco-sphere and beyond as two maestros of the dancefloor step into The Red Church for an Sunday service like no other..\n\nSystem Olympia\nWith one stiletto planted firmly in the bathhouse and the other stepping out of a vintage Mercedes, System Olympia oozes style with a selection to die for and unique universe in which she spins her sound. Spanning disco, house, boogie, italo, soul, jazz and rare grooves - all with a distinctive System Olympia touch. A prolific producer alongside her DJ ventures, reworking hiphop classics into sultry soulful numbers, dusty downtempo house cuts and melancholic italo for those eyes-closed dancefloor moments. In short, you better not miss this..\n\nDJ October\nA bona-fide icon of the booth with bags deeper than the Mariana Trench - we've secured a very special set which will see October trip through the sound of NYC's queer 80s disco to pumping italo synth lines, dirty house jackers and plenty of left turns and surprise selections... A truly genre defying and decade spanning DJ, strap in.\n\nBurly Chassis\nParadisco's resident weirdo-disco selector, warming up the sound system with tripped out balearic sounds, punk-funk edits, technicolour disco shimmer and no-wave dancefloor frenzy.\n\nWe're going extra intimate for this one, tickets in advance HIGHLY recommended.",

She earned the name 'Halgan' - The Fighter - in the 1980's when she was involved in the terrible war against the dictatorship. This afforded her admiration - but it is her music that has made her an icon. Uplifting yet reverent, it is music filled with soul and courage and love. Her music encapsulates the hope and strength of her community and has become deeply embedded in the heart of Somaliland.\n\nExiled to France, she started her group in Lyon with Aymeric Krol, Maël Salètes and Régis Monte. This ensemble gave the principles behind the music embodiment, allowing it to move people through their bodies - in other words it's music to dance to, with nods to afrobeat, tuareg and ethio-jazz. Her third album is the fruit of a search to elevate this important voice, expand it's sonic landscape and share it with a wider audience. It's called ‘Hiddo Dhawr’ (‘Preserve Culture’), which is also the name of the cultural centre that Sahra founded in 2013 in Hargeisa.\n\nEntry requirements: 14+, any under 18s accompanied by 21+ adult 1:1 ratio",

      "about": "Ear Trumpet Presents. Brooks Williams & Aaron Catlow Seated Show at Bristol Folk House, 40a Park St, BS1 5JG - All Ages (Under 18s to be accompanied by a responsible adult)\n\nDoors 7:00pm, Show 8:00pm\n\nBrooks Williams & Aaron Catlow create joyous and virtuosic music that not only tugs at the heart-strings but also gets you up on your feet. AmericanaUK writes, “how such a complete and sensational sound can come from just two voices and instruments is awe-inspiring.”\n\nA year on from their debut tour, the two have literally been wowing audiences at venues and festivals like St David’s Hall, Lichfield Guildhall, Folk In A Field Festival, Cumberland Arms, Ely Festival, The Folk House and The Atkinson, to name but a few.\n\nInspired by the response to their shows, Brooks Williams and Aaron Catlow have been back in the studio. This time with Josh Clark (Kate Rusby) at Get Real Audio. Alongside Jon Short (John Martyn Project) on double bass, they have created Greens And Blues, a vibrant collection of songs, some penned by Williams and others by Gillian Welch, Shirley Collins, Molly Tuttle, Rab Noakes and Sierra Ferrell, among others.\n\nThe playing on Greens And Blues has a spontaneity that reflects the hours and hours they have spent onstage in front of audiences. It’s a potent combination. Free and rooted all at once.\n\nOne of the eleven tracks on Greens And Blues is Dooley’s Farm (Molly Tuttle) about a farmer who is particularly adept at growing a very popular (but illegal) crop. The Williams/Catlow arrangement is dark and spooky, complete with sliding double bass lines and guitar arpeggios. Another is Wild Wild Wild (Brooks Williams), a description of a music venue Williams played in the earliest days of his career, that swings with reckless abandon, much like the venue itself. Gillian Welch’s Red Clay Halo gets a fertile reading from Brooks and Aaron, complete with nimble guitar picking, fiddle double-bowing and Aaron’s whistling!\n\nThroughout the recording, the interplay between Williams’ guitar and Catlow’s fiddle is out-of-this-world. Take Anniesland, one of Brooks’ songs. The fiddle kicks it off with a folky-old-timey riff. You think you know where it’s going. Then the guitar snakes its way into the middle of that with bluesy double-stops that turns the song on its head. The riff is so deep it sticks with you long after the song is over. On the late-great Rab Noakes’ Little Way Up, a previously unrecorded song from the Noakes’ back catalogue, guitar and fiddle go full-on country, doubling the melody in a way that would make the Tennessee Three proud.\n\nWith three albums under their belt, Ghost Owl in 2021 (nominated “Instrumental Album Of The Year” by Fatea) and Ready For The Times in 2022 (“a cracker,” says Living Tradition), and Greens And Blues in 2024, Brooks Williams and Aaron Catlow are moving deeper into their sound. There is literally no one else on the scene playing this kind of music. You see fiddle and guitar and you think you know what to expect, but Williams and Catlow deliver something completely different. They are a one-off. After virtually every gig they get asked to return for a future engagement.\n\nAaron Catlow is half of the Bristol-based duo Hawes And Catlow, with guitarist-singer Kit Hawes. He is also the fiddler in UK festival favourite Sheelanagig. Catlow's other credits including playing with Grammy Award-nominated Yola, Mad Dog Mcrea and Afro Celt Sound System.\n\nCambridge UK-based, Georgia US-born, Brooks Williams has a long-standing solo career in both North America and the UK and is also known for his collaborations with the likes of Dan Walsh, Sloan Wainwright, Hans Theessink, Boo Hewerdine, Guy Davis and Rab Noakes, among others. He is named one of WUMB-FM Boston's Top 100 All-Time Artists. Fatea refers to him as “one of those select few 'how on earth does he do it?!' artists.\"\n\nNot only are Brooks Williams and Aaron Catlow masters of their respective instruments, but the music they create, says Folk Radio UK, is “a thing of beauty!”\n\n“The audience loved every minute and afterwards begged them to return to the stage.... ” (Big Wheel Blues Club, Isle Of Man)\n\n\"One of the best nights ever. Great songs, great fun and wonderful musicianship. Do not hesitate. Go and see Brooks and Aaron while you can. You will have the best time.\" (Grateful Fred’s, The Atkinson, Southport)\n\n\"An outstanding performance of sublime quality, entertaining and beautifully paced. Two musicians at the top of their game.\"(RAFA Club, Cleethorpes)\n\neartrumpet\n\nEntry requirements: no age restrictions (under 18s to be accompanied by an adult over 21yrs, 1:1 ratio)",

Spearheaded by Sameer Khan, who's formally trained by a 600-year-old lineage of musicians from modern-day Pakistan, this group of multi-instrumentalists aims to bring timeless tradition to new realms.\n\nBy daring to embrace the Hindustani format while drinking from retro aesthetics and resignifying it all with the avant-gardism of neo-psych, they create something both recognizable and new.\n\nSet to release their debut album in 2023, the group became known for their captivating performances fuelled by a plethora of electrified folk instruments, and increasingly gained space in the live circuit, supporting established acts such as Witch, Os Mutantes Dur Dur Band and Sarathy Korwar.\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n18+ event.\nPresented by Gravy Train & BLG.\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\nGravy Train events • www.gravytrainbristol.co.uk\nBLG events • www.linktr.ee/BLGPromotions\n",

      "about": "Presented by the Bristol Radical History Group, Acts of Resistance is an opportunity to time-travel through radical history. This new project “Avant-Folk Punk-Opera is the new project of Steve Lake, of anarcho-/post punk band Zounds,[ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zounds ] rocking since the late 1970s.\n\nActs Of Resistance is a performance of songs, verse and prose commemorating and celebrating 1,000 years of protest and dissent by the commoners of England. Original songs and stories are merged with adaptations of traditional material and found stories to weave a continuous thread that links working people’s struggle across the generations. Hear the voices of history from below such as The Diggers, William Blake, and King Ludd.\n\nActs of Resistance features a redoubtable trio made up of Steve Lake (self-described “chief show off” with legendary anarcho-punk band Zounds, [https://zoundsonline.co.uk/ ] first appearing on Crass Records and nexus for all kinds of musical troublemakers), Bristolian Emo-folkster Aether Valentine, and Carl Phillip Louis (“folk-punk free-jazz mandolinist and singer/shouter of anarcho-romance poetry”).\n\nAfter the performance, Pete Webb of BRHG and DIY music publisher PC-Press will facilitate a question-and-answer session with Steve Lake of Zounds, an opportunity which should not be passed up lightly. As well as tours and friendships with Crass and The Poison Girls, Zounds were among the original wave of anarcho-punk bands, particularly The Mob, Astronauts, Blythe Power and the Poison Girls, all bands that regularly played West Country benefit gigs and free festivals during the late 1970s and early 1980s. From the outset Zounds lyrics have been political without being predictably didactic. They are also unnervingly melodic for fans of hardcore punk, featuring accessible rhythms and beats that gave them wide appeal beyond the punk scene, with danceable favourite as “Subvert” even having a distinctly ska rhythm.\n\nHistory is dead! Long live history… let’s make some more! Set your controls for the heart of the Microplex!",

      "about": "PLANTOID • www.instagram.com/plantoidworld\n\nMusically, Plantoid’s cauldron harnesses multiple subgenres at once to concoct a sort of primordial soup, the molecules of which are built as much from progressive rock as they are jazz, fusion, folk, and even a bit of ‘70s hard rock for good measure. The band began as the brainchild of Chloe and Tom Coyne, who met while pursuing music courses at Lincoln College in their teens. Quickly united by a passion for eclectic psychedelic rock, and far-out, emotionally charged songwriting, they formed the band Mangö and started gigging around town with drummer Louis Bradshaw, who Tom had been friends with since secondary school.\n\nAfter making a name for themselves locally, the three relocated to Brighton and recruited bassist Bernardo Larisch. Now a four-piece, and renamed Plantoid, the band were ready to dig even deeper into their shared influences, ranging from Miles Davis to Todd Rundgren, to Jeff Buckley, all the way around to the more acute experimental fare that gives Plantoid their razor-sharp edge. \n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\nSURFACE AIR • www.instagram.com/surfaceairband\n\nFrom the splintering bone ashes of prog, punk and the sallow remains of no-wave springs a rare bird of apocryphal breed. SURFACE AIR is a newly formed Bristol-based three piece and features Kilian Lee (WINDSHAKE) on guitar and vocals, Oliver Cocup (Lawi Anywar, My Octopus Mind) on drums and Arthur Harrison-Ward (Captain Gas, Dog Daughter) on bass.

With its mesmerizing black-and-white photography by Frederick Elmes and Herbert Cardwell, evocative sound design, and unforgettably enigmatic performance by Jack Nance, this visionary nocturnal odyssey continues to haunt American cinema like no other film.\n\nOnce seen, it's impossible to unsee. Lynch's nightmarish DIY destruction of the fourth, fifth and sixth walls of cinema needs to be watched again and again and again and again.",

Renowned for paddling days no one else wants to be using arm power alone, the last few years has seen him nominated for multiple big wave awards while competing on the big wave world tour.\n\nTom and Vans have given free rein to childhood friend and talented artist Jack Whitefield to give a deep psychedelic trip through Tom’s past and present. A fellow St.Ives born and raised, who is more formerly known for his photography, art and book making studies in the public eye, but behind closed doors has worked on many a video project.\n\nCommissioned by Vans Europe.\n",

Deceit. Magic. In F for Fake, a free-form sort-of documentary by Orson Welles, the legendary filmmaker (and self-described charlatan) gleefully re-engages with the central preoccupation of his career: the tenuous lines between illusion and truth, art and lies.\n\nBeginning with portraits of the world-renowned art forger Elmyr de Hory and his equally devious biographer, Clifford Irving, Welles embarks on a dizzying journey that simultaneously exposes and revels in fakery and fakers of all stripes—not the least of whom is Welles himself.\n\nCharming and inventive, F for Fake is both an inspired prank and a clever examination of the essential duplicity of cinema.\n\n---\n\nAbout Doozy:\n\nWe are a grassroots arts organisation aiming to offer a space for artists to exhibit and sell their work in a unique setting blending absurdist theatre, exhibition, immersive art, music, and performance into one space. We also produce zine to accompany our events filled with other interesting bits of forgery, art, and insight.\n\nAny questions about the show please contact doozymagazinee@gmail.com\n\nHope to see you there!\nKids welcome (finish time around 10PM)",

      "about": "Past Works Recycling Plant is a mixed-bill night of contemporary performance curated by artist duo Emergency Chorus.\n\nIn contrast to the more commonly found 'scratch night' for testing new work, Past Works Recycling Plant invites artists to instead 'recycle' old work. Expect reworked and remixed material, whirlwind retrospectives, undocumented gems, discarded ideas, or the very first work an artist made 10, 20, 30 years ago.\n\nPast Works Recycling Plant is a celebration of the ways that artists change and remain constant; an invitation to time-travel, making room for the unseen, the almost-forgotten, the stolen, the scribblings-in-the-margins, the what-was-was-there-all-along. We say: out with the new, and in with the old!\n\nLine-up includes:\nACTION HERO\nBUOYS BUOYS BUOYS\nANIA VAREZ\nANDREW NEIL HAYES\nEMERGENCY CHORUS\n\nThe Cube Microplex\n£10 standard / £7.50 open concessions (+£1 OTD)\n\nACTION HERO\n\nGemma Paintin & James Stenhouse have been working together under the moniker Action Hero since 2005. Using this name, they collaborate to create performances, installations, social practice, audio work and more. Independence is at the heart of the company’s ethos, alongside collaboration, a commitment to artist-led spaces and methodologies, and a belief in the power of art and creativity to give shape to the human experience. As well as extensive international touring to both critical and popular acclaim, the company has received grants, fellowships, commissions and residencies worldwide. They have published two books and contributed to several more. Action Hero are Forest Fringe associate artists and members of artist collectives Residence and The Brunswick Club.\n\nhttps://actionhero.org.uk/Home\n\nANIA VAREZ\n\nAnia Varez (they/them) is a Venezuelan dance artist based in Bristol. Their work lives somewhere in between the mediums of dance, community development, live art and writing. These days, they are interested in: ways of generating joy, of passing time, of being together, of creating change, of expanding our collective stories of migration, queerness and being alive today. On an ongoing journey to understand what a truly collaborative and inclusive practice might be, you're likely to find them working with many different people, often with folks who have never been in creative spaces before. Ania's work has been showcased internationally and in the UK, including SPILL Festival, Seoul Marginal Theatre Festival, Taipei Contemporary Arts Centre and Robert Howard Theatre. They are a proud member of Interval, an artist collective based in Bristol.\n\nhttps://www.aniavarez.com/\n\nANDREW NEIL HAYES\n\nAndrew Neil Hayes makes videos that are performances and performances that are videos; usually involving himself and / or a suit, live projection, earth, mud, dirt, sweat, tears. Based in Bristol, his work has been shown at festivals and galleries worldwide. He is also an active member of the local music scene, best known as leader of the psychedelic jazz not jazz band Run Logan Run.\n\nwww.andrewneilhayes.com\n\nBUOYS BUOYS BUOYS\n\nBuoys Buoys Buoys is a folklorist and multidisciplinary artist working between Swansea & Bristol. Producing performance, sculpture, and installation, they use their practice to engage communities in the retelling of Celtic folktales through absurd storytelling and public play, exploring themes of Queer masculinity, contemporary ritual magic, and working class Welsh folk culture.\n\nOver the last 2 years Buoys Buoys Buoys has performed and exhibited at Soho Theatre, Bristol Museum, Elysium Gallery (Swansea), Theatr y Sherman (Cardiff), and The Edinburgh Fringe Festival (2022, 2023), with upcoming projects at ArtHouse Jersey, Chapter Art Centre (Cardiff), Kit Form Gallery (Bristol), and Mission Gallery (Swansea).\n\nhttps://buoysbuoysbuoys.com/\n\nEMERGENCY CHORUS\n\nEmergency Chorus is Ben Kulvichit (he/him) and Clara Potter-Sweet (they/she). They make performances which straddle experimental theatre, live art and dance, often colliding disparate source materials to create collages of text, choreography, music and image. The work is ambiguous, playful, fragile, strange, appealing and troublesome. Recently, they have made a dance piece which predicts the future, a choir of town criers, and an improvised preposition salad.\n\nhttps://emergencychorus.com/\n\nAccessibility:\nThe Cube is an historic building with many steps required to access and get around the building, so unfortunately it is not accessible for wheelchair users.

Moral corruption, emotional disturbances, unstoppable laughter, murder, even insanity—these are just some of the dire consequences of a group of high school friends lured into the dark world of cannabis!\n\nIf one participates in the combustion and inhalation of herbal remedies we recommend doing so before the screening. Such delights can enhance the viewers experience.\n\nPlease note: Due to the shorter runtime, this film will start at a later time of 8:30 PM",
